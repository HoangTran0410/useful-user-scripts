## What's Aimbot

Locks the aim to the nearest player **(nearest to the cursor)**. Doesn't check if the player is behind the wall so it can make movements hard. Also doesn't auto-shoot. You have to sight and shoot yourself.

## What's ESP?

Shows players behind walls. Also shows a line between you and them. Good for keeping track of players who are behind you.
